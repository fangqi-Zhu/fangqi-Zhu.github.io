<!-- Hi, I‚Äôm Fangqi Zhu. I',  pursue my Ph.D. in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST, È¶ôÊ∏ØÁßëÊäÄÂ§ßÂ≠¶), supervised by Prof. Song Guo in PEILab.

I am currently a third-year M.Eng. student at [Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen (HITSZ)](https://www.hitsz.edu.cn/index.html). And I will join The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology as a PhD student in 2024 fall in the Department of [Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)] (https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/). I am fortunate to be advised by supervised by Prof. [Song Guo](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/admin/people/faculty/profile/songguo) in [PEILab] (https://peilab.netlify.app/). -->

I am an incoming Fall 2024 PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/) (CSE, HKUST). I am fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Song Guo](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/admin/people/faculty/profile/songguo) at [PEILab](https://peilab.netlify.app/). I received my Master's degree in 2024 from the [Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen](http://cs.hitsz.edu.cn/) (HITSZ), supervised by [Prof. Bin Qin](https://homepage.hit.edu.cn/qinbing) and [Prof. Ruifeng Xu](https://faculty.hitsz.edu.cn/xuruifeng). I received my Bachelor's degree in 2017 from [Wuhan University](https://cs.whu.edu.cn/).

My research interests focus on scaling up robot learning. Previously, I gained some experience in NLP. The long-term goal of my research is to develop a machine that can perceive, plan, and act in the real world like humans.

I am currently developing a generative world model for robot learning, which will enable automatic training and evaluation in a virtual environment.



<!-- interested in [MineDojo](https://minedojo.org/) (Minecraft simulator), [CALVIN](https://github.com/mees/calvin)(Robot arm simulator), and [Habitat 3.0](https://aihabitat.org/habitat3/) (Home simulator), and will base my research on this. If you are interested in collaborating, please contact me. I'm open to any form of cooperation. -->
